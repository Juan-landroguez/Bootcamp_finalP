# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a movie recommendation system designed to help users quickly and easily find movies to watch based on their individual preferences. The system utilizes a comprehensive database of more than 200,000 movies from the last century, including details like genres, runtime, year of release, directors, stars, ratings, and votes, as well as information on awards like Oscar nominations and prizes, and Cannes Film Festival selections.

## Approach and Methodology

To build the recommendation system, I utilized a clustering algorithm to group similar movies together based on a wide range of factors, including genre, runtime, and ratings. Once movies have been clustered, users can input their individual ratings for a variety of films, which the system then uses to make personalized movie recommendations based on the user's preferences.

## Data Sources

The data for this project was obtained from several sources, including:

- A massive open database from Kaggle that contains information on more than 200,000 movies
- Another open database from Kaggle that contains a comprehensive history of Oscar awards
- Web scraping of Wikipedia to obtain information on awards from the Cannes Film Festival

## Installation and Usage

To use the movie recommendation system, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine and open the `main.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook. From there, follow the instructions to input your ratings and receive personalized movie recommendations.

## Conclusion

By combining advanced algorithms with user input, my movie recommendation system provides highly accurate and personalized movie recommendations, saving users time and energy when it comes to deciding what movie to watch. I hope this system proves useful for anyone looking to enjoy a movie night with family, friends, or loved ones.
